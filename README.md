# FBI Wanted Analysis
This repository contains code for fetching data from the FBI's API endpoint for wanted criminals, processing the data using Pandas and other data cleaning techniques.

## Data Collection
The code in this repository fetches data from the FBI's API endpoint for wanted criminals. The data includes information such as the name of the criminal, their wanted status, and their crime history, etc.

## Data Cleaning and Processing
The fetched data is processed and cleaned using Pandas and other data cleaning techniques. The processed data is then analyzed using NumPy, NetworkX, and other tools to uncover patterns in criminal activity.

# Update
The processed data is then clustered to uncover patterns in criminal activity using Python. However, the project was killed before any meaningful patterns could be identified. The reason for this was the inability to use categorical data in finding patterns, which made it difficult to analyze the data effectively. The project was terminated due to challenges in identifying meaningful patterns in the criminal activity data.
